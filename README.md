# Pong Game
This is a game called 'Pong', made using Python with a library called turtle.
It has two pedals, one on either side of the screen, and a ball. The game is designed such that the ball should only come in contact with the pedal and hence bounce back. If the ball touches the left or right side of the screen the opponent player gains a point.
